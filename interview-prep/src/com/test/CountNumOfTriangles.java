/**
 * Given an unsorted array of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with 
 * three different array elements as three sides of triangles. For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, 
 * the sum of any two values (or sides) must be greater than the third value (or third side). 
 * 
 * For example, if the input array is {4, 6, 3, 7}, the output should be 3. 
 * There are three triangles possible {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}. 
 * Note that {3, 4, 7} is not a possible triangle. 
 * 
 * As another example, consider the array {10, 21, 22, 100, 101, 200, 300}. 
 * There can be 6 possible triangles: {10, 21, 22}, {21, 100, 101}, {22, 100, 101}, 
 * {10, 100, 101}, {100, 101, 200} and {101, 200, 300}
