Issues:
- Sorting based on price/reviews/relevance
- Improve search quality - need to show relevant places, shows far off places, 
show how much far it is from where you want to go etc.
- Some analytics on who booked in the past 2-3 days, who is currently looking etc., how many people recommend etc.
- expensive searches, bad photos, 
- neighborhood info - safe / unsafe etc
- Airbnb vs Hotels
	- quality issues (helpful reviews like amazon could help)
	- difficult booking experience
	- free breakfasts, gym, spas etc.
- Similarity based suggestions should be relevant
- keyword based searching should be supported along with location search
- more instant bookings options and well communicated - have helpful reviews to choose last min bookings
- lot of human interaction - talk to host, chat, fix arrival times, wait for host response etc., 
  disturbing hosts too much
- lot of friction with key pickups etc.

Features:
- Social sharing feature
- Integration with Bots and IOT devices - google home, Amazon echo etc.
	- booking through IOT devices
	- Chat with bots to get questions about the house answered
	- extend Airbnb app to help interact with it once checked in to the house
		- eg: "Ask Airbnb what's the wifi password?" "Ask Airbnb where are there extra towels" 
			"Sorry I don't know the answer to that question, let me ask the host and I'll get back to you" 
			(building the database of FAQ in the background)
- different experiences for travel type - eg: tourist/fun, for work, visit friends family, romantic getaway
- different travel partners - family, your partner, friends, colleague etc. 
- Airbnb tonight - just like hotel tonight..last minute booking in a city.
- Tie up with uber/lyft etc. for pickup/dropoff service. Inbuilt integration would help
- Airbnb Miles - just like airline or hotel membership programs...earn rewards for more travel etc.
- Food service integration - stocked up fridge, lunch/dinner waiting when you arrive etc.
